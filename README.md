# DIY Fine Particulate Masks
This is an open source project that utilizes science and engineering to design and develop fine particulate masks that are:

1. Accessible 
2. Effective

In the short term, we are hoping to develop the most effective DIY masks based on available peer reviewed publications while keeping accessibility in mind.

In the long term, we are seeking to develop means to characterize performance of the design through qualitative and quantitative methods.
